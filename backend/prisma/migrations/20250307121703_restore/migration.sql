/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `user` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[id]` on the table `user` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - The required column `id` was added to the `user` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
